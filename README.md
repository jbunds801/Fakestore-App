This fake store is made using the FakeStoreAPI and React, and React Bootstrap. I wanted to keep the design clean, simple, and responsive and tried to use as little CSS as possible, mostly sticking to Bootstrap. I added a carousel image to the home page using "fetch" from the API. I made all of the product containers on the products page the same size regardless of image size to keep things consistent. 

As per the assignment requirements, it has multiple components using React Router to make navigation possible between the pages, and forms to submit and change data from the API using "post" and "put". It has a product page that maps all of the products using "get" from the API, as well as a page for details for each product. There is also a delete product functionality that uses the "delete" request. All of the API requests were done using AXIOS. The add to cart button however does not have functionality.
